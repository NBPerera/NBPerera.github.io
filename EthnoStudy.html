    <h1> Ethnographic Research on Student-Lecturer Interaction</h1>
        <h2> Why is Ethnographic Research Important for UX? </h2>
        <p> Focusing on the User Experience aspects, the knowledge of this kind of research, is very useful when conducting studies with potential customers. Participants in interviews, focus groups, usability testing and more, communicates us much more information than we realize. Performing with ethnographic research methodologies means, to be able to see what is unseen. While this was not trivial at the beginning, after few field studies the ability to detect behaviours in interactions started to be more obvious. To gather this data, one must make best use of field notes. The latter may not be as easy as expected, because not only you are taking notes of what the participants communicate actively, but also what they communicate passively. These are key to extrapolate patterns among participants, and by capturing the smaller details in people's interactions with the system, it is possible to achieve a product more suitable to the users.</p>
        <h2> Which Skills were involved?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Passive Observation - observing participants without being involved in the scene</li>
            <li> Active Observation -  participating in the scene, while observing </li>
            <li> Interviewing - gather data through key questions</li>
            <li> Analysis of Data - Understanding of the data gathered through field notes, and extrapolation of important behavioural patterns </li>
            <li> Reporting - Communicating the result of the study, through written and oral communication </li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h2> Project Summary</h2>
        <p> The work was carried out at University of Nottingham, and analysed the behaviours and interaction activity between students and lecturers. This study examined the explicit and implicit interactions that happens before, during, and after a lecture. Now the members that play the biggest role here are obviously the students and the lecturer. Nevertheless, the study showed also the importance of the materials used in the scenario. Slides in this case become almost an active participant, which routed the lecture towards communication. The importance of gestures and gazes are shown here in different examples, and how these contribute to give lots of information. One of the most seen event, is the occurrence of silence. Silence itself would communicate nothing. Although it has demonstrated itself that in a certain context it sends a message as clear as a verbal one. Furthermore, plays a role in social pressure. By this I mean, how long silence creates an awkward atmosphere, which pushes the students to speak. Interesting is also the techniques used from the lecturers to conduct the students to an answer without giving the answer at all, but only by asking the right questions. After examining the lecturer more than once, repeating the same actions, we can start to see some peculiar behaviours. This are usually very subtle and are for example gazes, certain gestures, certain word phrasing, intonations and etc... The goal of the speaker is not only to share information but also to maintain a certain level of attention. In Conclusion, lecturing seemed to be an activity full of interactions and visible at first sight. This demonstrated to be partially false. The study has shown to have many subtle interactions which are not visible at initially. It is only after a certain amount of time dedicated to dissecting single episodes, that these members methods come to surface.
